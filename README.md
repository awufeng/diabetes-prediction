Diabetes is a growing global health concern that affects millions worldwide and presents major challenges to healthcare systems. Early identification of individuals at risk is critical. Timely intervention can reduce complications, improve quality of life, and lower healthcare costs.

Traditional diagnostic methods often rely on clinical tests performed only after symptoms emerge, which limits opportunities for preventive care. Compounding this challenge, real-world healthcare data is highly imbalanced: the number of non-diabetic patients far exceeds those diagnosed with diabetes. 

This project tackles these challenges by:

- Applying the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the training data.

- Evaluating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to identify the most effective model for improving recall (sensitivity), precision, and overall predictive performance.


By leveraging resampling techniques and machine learning models, this work demonstrates how predictive tools can support clinicians in early detection and targeted intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and resource allocation.
